How do we format dates? currently I have "D MMM yyyy h:mm A"
How many releases per product are we expecing? If it is a lower number (less than a couple of hundred (1 release per month for 10 years = 120)) then filtering client side makes sense.
How do we handle text with links/calls to action in the middle of it? What do we do about translations?
